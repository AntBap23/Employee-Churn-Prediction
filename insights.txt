Data Analysis Key Findings
Correlation Analysis: satisfaction_level shows the strongest negative correlation with churn (-0.39), while time_spend_company has a moderate positive correlation (0.14). Other numerical features show weaker correlations.
Categorical Analysis: Employees with 'low' salaries have a significantly higher churn proportion (approximately 29.7%) compared to those with 'medium' (approximately 20.4%) and 'high' salaries (approximately 6.6%). 'Department' also shows some variation in churn rates across categories.
Feature Engineering: Polynomial and interaction terms were created, including satisfaction_level_sq and interactions between salary levels and numerical features like average_montly_hours, time_spend_company, and number_project. One-hot encoding was applied to categorical features.
Regression Analysis (Logistic Regression): Features with the largest absolute coefficients in the logistic regression model include satisfaction_level (6.06), promotion_last_5years (2.51), satisfaction_level_sq (1.91), and Work_accident (1.62), suggesting these have strong linear relationships with the log-odds of churn. Some interaction terms, particularly those involving 'low' salary, also showed relevance.
Feature Selection: Based on the analyses, a set of 25 features were selected for the churn prediction model, including original numerical and binary features, engineered polynomial and interaction terms, and dummy variables for categorical features.
Model Performance: A Random Forest Classifier trained on the selected features achieved the following performance metrics on the test set: Accuracy: 0.9893, Precision: 0.9810, Recall: 0.9715, F1-Score: 0.9762, and AUC-ROC: 0.9963. These high scores indicate the model performs very well at predicting churn.
Insights or Next Steps
The analysis confirms that employee satisfaction, salary level, time spent at the company, work accidents, and promotions are significant factors influencing churn. The engineered features, particularly related to satisfaction and salary interactions, also contribute positively to the model's predictive power.
The high performance metrics suggest that the selected features and the Random Forest model are effective for churn prediction in this dataset. Future steps could involve exploring other advanced modeling techniques, conducting further hyperparameter tuning for the Random Forest model, and investigating the business implications of the identified key drivers of churn to develop targeted retention strategies.
